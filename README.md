# MovieWebsite

Welcome to the Movie App! This application allows users to explore popular movies, search for specific titles, filter by genre, and view detailed information about individual movies.

 ## Features

### Home Page

Displays a list of the top 10 popular movies.
Provides links to navigate to the home page and the movies page.

### Movies Page

Lists all available movies.
Real-time search functionality:
As the user types in the search field, the movie list updates in real time with the search results.
There is a 500ms delay between the user typing and the update of results.
The URL contains the searchTerm as a query parameter.

### Genre filtering

Dropdown with multi-select functionality:
Users can select multiple genres.
Option to clear all selected genres.
Clicking an already selected genre deselects it.
When selecting/deselecting a genre, the URL reflects the chosen genres.
Genre list updates based on the searched results only.
Search and genre filtering work in conjunction:
Example URL: http://localhost:4200/movies?searchTerm=dragon&genre=Adventure
Refreshing the page retains the userâ€™s filter/search.
Clearing the search does not clear the movie genre filter and vice versa.

### Movie Page

Displays detailed information about an individual movie:

### Movie poster

Title
Genres
Popularity (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Budget (Currency set to Euro)
Uses the Movie.slug for the URL parameter.

Ordered by last visited first.
Persists even after the user refreshes the browser.
